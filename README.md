# Weather App (PWA)

A Progressive Web App that can display the weather information of the given city

## Usage
- Go to the [Live Demo](https://weather-app.wajid.me/)
- Type the city and press _Enter_

## Install Locally
```
$ git clone https://github.com/wajid-nv/weather-pwa.git

$ cd weather-pwa

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

### What I used
- React
- Axios
- OpenWeatherMap API

### What I learned
This is first time I am working with PWA. I learned how to work with **service workers**, **offline handling** and a lot of other things that are related to making of a PWA. As I used **OpenWeatherMap API**, it was a great chance to practice **axios** and working with APIs.
